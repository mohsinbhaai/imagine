            <p>OVER A DECADE OF EXCELLENCE</p>
            <p>“We do not want to be know as the biggest integration company, we want to be known as the BEST
                Integration company in the region and in the world.”</p>
            <p>Imagine Group Limited and Imagine Technologies LLC were founded in 2004 and 2005
                respectively, and are products of the passion, imagination and innovation of the Founders,
                who took their personal love of music and audio-visual technology to a space where they could
                share their expertise and vision with like-minded others and to fulfill a knowledge gap in the
                marketplace, driven by the need to raise the bar in terms of what was possible when it came to
                music systems, home theater and home automation in the Middle East, Africa and the Indian Sub-continent.</p>
            <p>The business has evolved and grown over the years, with an ever-expanding portfolio of world-class
                brands and products, systems and technologies as well as a similarly passionate team of specialists
                and technicians, some of whom have been with us since inception.</p>
            <p>Our success over the last decade has always relied on two guiding principles: working meticulously
                towards creating amazing experiences for our clients; and building relationships that evolve way
                beyond project completion.</p>
            <p>Imagine is an equal opportunity employer, and integrity and business ethics are valued.</p>
            <p>OUR MISSION</p>
            <p>“To deliver bespoke, information technology, high-performance entertainment, automation and related
                solutions, by combining cutting-edge technologies with the finest products and consultative services
                in the world for our clients.”</p>

            <h2>WHY IMAGINE?</h2>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 text-content2">
            <p>The following details are why so many of the most discriminating clients have chosen to work with Imagine
                in the past, and continue to call on us again and again.</p>
            <p>SIMPLE USER INTERFACE</p>
            <p>The best technologies are simple to use. Decades of experience have taught us what clients love and what
                they have no interest in. The user interface for our systems has earned many awards—even from our
                industry peers.</p>
            <p>SENSITIVE TO INTERIOR DESIGN</p>
            <p>The best technologies meld into the home’s architecture and furnishings. Architects, designers, and
                builders choose Imagine first because of our experience and approach to making technology blend
                seamlessly into spaces.</p>
            <p>ARTISANAL LEVEL OF CRAFTMANSHIP</p>
            <p>It’s not what we do, it’s how we do it. Imagine’s work is meticulous and we employ people that are
                passionate about quality. Our technicians consistently win peer-awards for their craftsmanship.</p>
            <p>ENTERPRISE GRADE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</p>
            <p>IT is not just for the office anymore. System reliability depends on robust network architecture.
                Imagine’s networks are enterprise-grade, not DIY. Imagine employs highly trained IT professionals who
                specialize in and deliver enterprise-grade networks.</p>
            <p>PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY LEADERS</p>
            <p>Everyone who works on a project is part of the Imagine family — carefully chosen employees and partners.
                Each Partner is a leader in their own right in their area of expertise.</p>
            <p>FOCUSED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE, NOT GIZMOS</p>
            <p>Our passion is seeing our clients enjoy using the technology systems we deliver. With over 10 years of
                delivering cutting edge technology systems we've long-since outgrown the fascination with technology
                itself, but retained our passion for it. However, we are focused on the comfort, convenience,
                entertainment, and peace of mind that we can provide for our clients. The technology is just an
                enabler.</p>
            <p>CLIENT RETENTION</p>
            <p>Our clients come back, time and time again. Many of our clients have used us for their second, third, and
                even fourth properties. And when their colleagues or friends rave about the experience, they send them to
                us. We love new clients. But we love our existing clients just as much. Our first couple of clients who took
                a chance with us when we were a startup and did not even have an office, are still our clients today.</p>
