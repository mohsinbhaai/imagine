                    <div class="desc">
                        Surveillance systems provide views of your property from strategically placed cameras and
                        can be watched on TV, in-wall touch panels or even from your computer via the internet.
                        Protect your employees at work with the installation of a CCTV system and digital video
                        recorder. Keep an eye on housekeeping staff or the entranceway. Cameras can augment the
                        security system by triggering audible alarms, scene recording, or email generation when
                        they sense motion in the area.
