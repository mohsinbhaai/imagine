                        energy-efficient design. Custom-tailored lighting control will allow you to change the mood
                        of any area of your vessel to suit the occasion. Whether you are watching TV, dining or
                        entertaining, one press of a button can create the ideal atmosphere. Intelligent lighting
                        also contributes to a safe environment by linking with the security system to turn lights
                        on if un- invited activity is detected. New construction or upgrade - let us fashion a
                        lighting solution perfect for you.

                        streaming series, all with the equipment in one location (keeping the clutter out of each

                        With cameras in and around your vessel, you can monitor activities whether you’re in the
                        craft or halfway around the globe. We can route your security system through a central
                        monitoring system, alerting you via email or text message of events that you predetermine.
                        If the temperature in your control room exceeds a certain level, or there’s a leak, you
                        can be notified immediately. If they are integrated with your control system, you can
                        adjust the temperature or contact repair specialists remotely.
